# Aseprite Attachment System

The Aseprite Attachment System is an experimental plugin to manage
hierarchies of sprites using tiles & tilesets. The general idea is to
be able to create characters attaching and reusing parts of their body
through all the animations, making high-framerate and modular
characters possible in pixel-art.

Sponsored by [Soupmasters](https://soupmasters.com/) to manage huge
animations in [Big Boy Boxing](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1680780/Big_Boy_Boxing/).

This extension is a work-in-progress, based on ideas of Soupmasters

it useful for your own game.
